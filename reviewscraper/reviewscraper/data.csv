B0CRDCXRK2,"I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday! Excellent purchase! Here is my pros and cons after a week of owning this:Con:1. 1920 x 1200 FHD 165Hz Display is very much an downgrade against my Legion 5 Pro 16"" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD 165Hz Display... But I guess with the parts offered, ASUS had to make some budget cuts somewhere I guess... (for the model I've chosen and not wanting to spend more than $1500 USD).2. Automatic MUX Switching is annoying... it optimizes which option to best suit for your current usage at the time (e.g. if you ran an game vs closing the game and brings you to the desktop). The automatic switch seems like its great and all but it ruins the display setting and when an game is playing, it switches again and sends you back to the desktop and ruins the display setting/resolution once more... Its best to just set it on the dedicated GPU option so you dont have to deal with this...3. Standard SSD Capacity is too low (again with cost saving measures but literally everyone these days just buy additional SSD stick anyways)... so snagged an SK.Hynix P41 SSD 2TB stick on sale to manually install for loading heavy application and games on there; really easy to install and easy to unscrew the back; there is an empty NVMe Gen4 M.2 2280 slot for you to install your SSDWorks Great after installing correctly and no Issues now! (make sure after install of SSD, just load into Windows and open up disk management to reformat (quick format! never full on SSD!) No need to tinker with BIOS setting...Do not tighten the SSD screws too much where the stick bends! thats incorrect! screw in ever so slightly so that the stick itself wont lodge out or move at all.Pros:1. RTX 4060 8GB - 140W Max TGP2. i7-13650HX - beats my Ryzen-7 5800H on my Legion 5 Pro3. RGB bar looks awesome!4. Battery 90WhNeutral:1. RGB Keys - heard mixed reviews on ASUS's design on this; of course, the Legion 5 RGB keyboard design is the best of the best but this is just okay and its not too bad in my eyes.2. Same weight and nearly the same dimensions as my Legion 5 Pro so portability is the same-ish but way better than my old MSI gaming laptop from 2017 where you can put this in your backpack and still have room to put other accessories and such.This is all I've noticed currently but either way, its a great mid-tier gaming laptop! I can run cyberpunk all max setting without issues or framerate drops and every other AAA game titles up to this point... This laptop should last an long time until AAA games becomes more graphically intense and requiring more processing power... but again this is the best you can get for your money and highly recommend!",Excellent Deal!

B0CRDCXRK2,"The specs are really good for this laptop. I love how you can even play with 100 FPS or even more in some games (Halo infinite,  Apex Legends, The Finals) with the silent mode (without overheating or having the max power of the CPU/GPU). If you want to get over 100+, the turbo mode (taking full advantage of the GPU/CPU) will be great + the 165.1 Hz. The only ""issue"" (not issue honestly if you do not see this as problem) is the turbo mode makes the laptop sounds a bit loudly which is normally when you are utilizing it with the full capacity. Other than that, you can have an amazing experience playing on this mode.This version specifically does not have the numeric pad included. I originally thought it was going to be, but the i9 version has it, this one does not.Sound experience is good enough considering this is a gaming laptop, but by using headsets, the sound changes considerably, so good point to have the direct connectionWifi is the fastest and best one I've ever seen personally. I have played online getting 80+ pin (considering I'm from Colombia and pin does not get below that normally) easily. The experience can change a bit with cable, but there is not a big change at least on my end. Long story short, wifi is really attractive if you do not mind losing or having some ms more.Finally, this is something NOT related to the laptop. When I placed the order, I trusted on the platform by adding ""automatic"" location. This caused a delay of 5 business days. I contacted Amazon and the delivery company and Amazon could not change the shipment address because it had been already shipped. After several back and forth calls, none of the companies was able to support or make it faster which I understand, but I felt super uncomfortable knowing my order was in my city and Amazon did not attempt to address the situation.  So please be careful and I recommend to add the location manually BEFORE making the order.If you are looking to jump into a medium/high performance laptop with no more than 1,500, this is a great option.",Best laptop price/specs,True,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars
B0CRDCXRK2,"Rceiving a warranty extension from ASUS for this Review*Right out of the gate this laptop is impressive. Everything I've thrown at it, it's played very well. The new 40 series graphics cards features really help with this. The laptop is sturdily built with no deck flex around the keyboard. The screen is 1200p which is a little more than FHD and in the 16"" size it looks great. No lightbleed and a strong contrast ratio. Yes you can easily open it up and replace the memory and add another m.2 SSD. The memory is dual channel and the m.2 size is the full length size. Yes the thing is quiet even under some light load. Of course the fans will ramp up if you throw something very demanding at it BUT looking at temps for the CPU/GPU show that it's very well cooled. I haven't seen the CPU go over 85c nor the GPU over 65c as of yet.The power plug is in an odd spot though, it's in the center of the right hand side and with the power brick being so large that might cause trouble for some when trying to position it somewhere. There's an odd issue with the 3.5mm headphone jack where using an earbud with an inline microphone can cause some weird sound issues. Upon looking online I see that low impedance headphones might suffer from these sorts of issues on certain laptops. In my testing using expensive headphones with high impedance show no sign of this issue so that could very well be the issue. I also find the trackpad can be a bit funky, it will sometimes not register clicks and more frequently won't register two finger scrolling correctly. I've tried reinstalling drivers and tweaking settings for both the audio/trackpad issue but nothing has seemed to help. This is a new laptop after all so I'm hoping these issues can get sorted out soon.","A great gaming/all around laptop, not perfect but close to it.",True,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars
B0CRDCXRK2,"Disclaimer: I am writing this review to avail 90 day warranty extensionI am writing this review almost two months after I received this beast. It has been a smooth-ish experience. It is amazing for the price. I like that it can run all my games, and I have also used it for programming. It is definitely good as an all-rounder. The battery life is unexpectedly good. Once it reached more than seven hours, which is supreme for a Windows machine. I like the large trackpad. The RGB is also a good addition. Though the laptop becomes loud in turbo mode, I find myself keeping it on either silent or balanced mode, depending on the FPS I am trying to achieve.It runs Cyberpunk max settings with path tracing at 80 FPS native resolution with DLSS Quality at 70 FPS. I can confidently say it can run every game out there at max settings.The only downside is the SSD. Maybe it is just my model, or I am not sure, but the laptop becomes extremely slow while downloading games from Steam, Epic Games, etc. It is almost unusable. Task Manager shows disk at 100% while showing only 50 MB/s writes, which are initially 200, etc. I am not sure about this, but it is not much of a hassle. I only notice it when games are updating or installing. I guess they had to cut corners to make this such a great price. The Black Friday sale made this laptop even more worth it. I paid 1300$ because it had to be shipped to Qatar. It is much cheaper than the alternatives here, though, so worth it.Overall, I am giving this laptop a 5 stars. If only the SSD was better, this would be a perfect laptop. I guess I will probably buy a better SSD later, as this laptop has two NVMe slots.",My First ever Laptop it soo good definetly worth it.

B0CRDCXRK2,The laptop came with bad packaging. When opening the box the laptop came almost opened? like it was previously opened before?? Keep in mind that i ordered this laptop new so it’s almost as if the package was resealed and was opened before selling to a customer which is quite ridiculous . The laptop had other major issues such as the boot not loading at all when turning on the laptop u would see the “ROG” loading screen with the dead pixels “the horizontal lines i was talking about” which i had to watch multiple videos to figure out how to get past the bootloop because the laptop had an error called “inaccessible_boot_device” not to mention the other major issue it had with the laptop screen.. The Amazon laptop link advertised the screens refresh rate being 165hz and the laptop was displaying “64 hz” when i managed to fix the bootloop was talking about earlier making this laptop completely useless to be fair. This laptop also didnt come with wifi which is kind of surprising considering this cost me 1200 $ + not including tax so u would think they would at least add wifi support so u can see other networks but no. ? also considering the fact that other and cheaper laptops have them installed?? unless it was just my laptop that didn’t come with it ? taking into consideration that my package looked like it had been previously opened before i received it(came with no plastic wrap on the laptop covering it and came with no manuals ) (i am currently in the process of returning this item so hopefully i don’t get charged or deducted any amount i paid dude to there not being any manuals or plastic wrap on my laptop i received.

B0CRDCXRK2,"I had been looking at replacing my old HP laptop for a while now but WOW was this so much more than I expected! My HP played Baldur's Gate 3 at an average of a whopping 7 fps and that was a painful experience. The load times were god awful. The Asus ROG STRIX g16, though, has no trouble running it, even if I push everything to the highest settings possible. I usually get somewhere between 42 fps and 63 fps minimum now during my sessions. The Final Fantasy 14 Dawntrail benchmark also runs beautifully, which I'm very pleased about since the whole point in upgrading my computer was so I met the minimum requirements for Dawntrail when it releases.The packaging for this laptop was really nice. Opening it was just as much of an experience as turning it on for the first time. The keyboard feels great when typing and I love that the little bumps that help you figure out where your fingers are without looking includes W. It's an incredibly customizable laptop as well with easy to access bays for the hard drives. I haven't upgraded mine yet, but it'll be a breeze when I get around to it.Overall, I'm in love with this laptop. I knew I'd like it based on reviews and specs, but I ended up liking it even more than I expected to. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an upgrade without paying $2000+ for a computer. I had honestly thought to build a desktop but I need the portability of a laptop.

B0CRDCXRK2,"i7-13650HX 13th, llego con algunas fallas .-un leve ruido internamente que no proviene de los ventiladores y aun no lo he abierto para ver de donde viene el ruido (no sucede seguido, solo es algunas veces) y no afecta para nada en el rendimiento, se puede jugar, editar y todo normal. No creo que sea un problema grave.-A veces las aplicaciones fallaban, se congelaba y se reiniciaba solo (no sucedía muy seguido). He realizado diagnósticos para saber si algún componente provocaba estos errores pero no se encontró ningún problema, y hasta ahora descubrí que las apps de Asus (myasus y armoury crate) era lo que provocaba el tema de que las apps se cierren o que se congelara el portátil, así que las reinstale y actualmente se corrigió la mayoría de esos errores, pero aun suele dejar de funcionar el explorador de archivos, la barra de tareas y pocas veces las apps se dejan de funcionar. Así que recomiendo reinstalar las apps de Windows, restablecer la BIOS al modo fabrica y reinstalar Windows (que es lo próximo que hare porque estoy seguro de que solo es problemas con Windows que tal vez se configuro mal durante la instalación)*No me gusto la parte de atrás ya que viene con relieves lo que dificulta usar soportes, es por eso que tuve que colocar los soportes uno mas abajo que el otro para poder nivelarlo, pero recomiendo colocar soportes en la parte de atrás para que el aire pueda circular mejor, además que también sirve para que el cable del cargador pueda bajar un poco para que no se caliente por la salida de aire (como esta en la imagen).*En cuanto a juegos Assassin's creed syndicate en gráficos máximos da hasta 60 fps (es el único juego que he instalado hasta ahora).*La pantalla no es de tan alta resolución si eres exigente en ese aspecto, pero se mira muy bien.*La batería dura 2 horas mirando peliculas, que es lo normal en laptop gamer (en armoury crate en modo gpu, viene seleccionado ""estándar"" recomiendo seleccionar ""optimizado"" que hará que la RTX se desactive y solo use la grafica integrada) esto hará durar un poco mas la batería, también activar el ahorro de batería.*un consejo, si no te reconoce la RTX, intenta cambiando el modo gpu en armoury crate.En resumen, me gusta mucho este portátil y fue una buena compra. También decir que hable con el vendedor explicando los problemas que tenia la laptop y me dio la opción de devolverlo para el reembolso (me indico que se revisaba la falla y según eso el envió de la devolución se me devolvía y me daba el reembolso) pero como explique, solo es cuestión de reinstalar.",Es un portátil potente i7-13650HX 13th,True,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars
B0CRDCXRK2,Comprado para black friday por 1100 dolares sin duda alguna es una oferta que tenia que aprovechar esta maquina fue elegida entre las opciones de una acer nitro 16 y un msi creator con casi las mismas caracteristicas.La he estado poniendo a prueba durante 15 dias y hay varias caracteristicas que me han impresionado al igual que detalles menores que no mucho me gustaron.El diseño de la laptop es impresionante un diseño bastante bueno y con detalles que hace sentir que adquiriste un buen producto premium el aura sync de la pantalla tiene un efecto bastante bonito pero me hubiera gustado que incluyera el numberpad en el mousepad a parte que no incluye teclado numerico esto es malo para mi ya que me servia para programar pero con unas configuraciones al teclado lo pude arreglar pero para escribir ecuaciones me sigue afectando.Conectividad es casi perfecta pero no me gusto qie quitaran un usb tipo A ya que siempre uso los 3 puertos usb tipo A me vi obligado a comprar un HUB para tener mas puertos y no le vendria mal un lector de tarjetas SD.Rendimiento simplemente una bestia puede con todos los trabajos de la universidad para correr juegos es muy excelente y corre mis juegos arriba de los 165 fps perfecto para aprovechar la pantalla de 165 hertz y no necesitas el modo ultimate para lograrlo en juegos como l4d2 o genshin impact he probado el equipo con el juego mas pesado de mi biblioteca shadow of the tomb raider con los graficos mas altos posibles y he obtenido 80 fps no baja de esa cantidad es lo suficiente para jugar comodo si desactivas el vsinc obtendras 120 fps para que puedas aprovechar mejor la pantalla de 165 hertz.Detalles menores que no me gustaron:Por lo visto en los comentarios la pantalla es delicada y si ya empece a tener problemas con ella algunas veces cuando cierro y abro la laptop la pantalla disminuye su resolucion y se cambia automaticamente a los graficos integrados puedes corregir esto en el panel de nvidia deshabilitando los graficos integrados pero la resolucion siempre se disminuye y hay que ir al panel de configuracion a corregirlo esta es la principal razon por la cual le baje una estrella tambien cuando tienes activado el aura sync wallpaper y abres el navegador chrome la pantalla parapdea estuve averiguando y la razon es el aura wallpaper.Probablemente actualice en 6 meses pero en conclusion valio la pena los 1100 dolares.,Perfecta para la universidad :D,True,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars

B0CRDCXRK2,"I've been using this Laptop for about a year now, only real negative i have to say about it is there's occasions where the  'Armoury Crate' app( which is the application that controls your fans speeds and RGB lighting) crashes causing the whole laptop to hard crash. It's only happened about six times in total; Bios Updates has made this less common but i think i should mention it regardless. This is the best ""gaming"" laptop on the market for the price. If you want something ""better"" you'll have to cough up a pretty penny going into enthusiast territory; for marginal upgrades with diminishing returns.  I've looked around quiet a bit for other computers in this price range, so far this is the best one I've found.

It does happen but it's rare, it will hard crashed caused by it's Fan and RGB software. updates made it stable but still worth noting.2.

I'm sure they can be turned off but there was no flash card in the box that told me how.  It's probably a simple combo keypress.  Anyway, I set up Windows and rebooted after the first round of Windows' updates.  It booted into the bios on the section for flashing the bios.  Weird.  I didn't interrupt the boot process.  It did have a message to plug in the laptop even though it was 95% charged.  I exited the bios and powered off/on.  Same thing.  I decided to plug it in and powered off/on again and let it along.  After 10 or so minutes, I see what you see in the video.  Seemed like it wanted my attention so I press a key and there's Windows.  Ok, that looks good.  But why is it flashing like that?  Windows had been updated and loaded.  There was nothing that told me I needed to do anything.  So I let it be and after a minute or so, it went back to the flashy process in the video.  I pressed a key and logged into Windows and everything was fine after that.  I'm not sure why this thing had to flash like that just to tell me Windows was ready to log in to.Aside from that, it seems like a great machine.  It's built like a tank without being too heavy.  Screen is pretty.  The few games I tried (American Truck Simulator, Euro Truck Simulator, Mars 2030) played beautifully.Anyway, maybe that's a silly reason to give it 3 stars.

On the one hand, it is excellent for gaming on 1080p, on the other hand, it also allows you to play in high resolutions using DLSS 3 / 3.5.More expensive laptops with RTX 4070 will indeed provide higher performance, but the card also comes with 8GB of RAM, which means that at higher resolutions it will probably cause a bottleneck.Cheaper laptops with RTX 4050 are not worth the price since the card is both weaker and has only 6GB of RAM - can bottleneck some modern games even on 1080p.The rest of the hardware - the CPU delivers great performance, the RAM is not soldered and therefore can be upgraded if needed and there is an additional slot for an another SSD.I bought it on sale ($1100 before tax and shipping) and am very satisfied, definitely recommend.",Great laptop for the price,True,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars

B0CRDCXRK2,"Overall, this laptop is great, and it's already been serving me well, there's just a few problems with it. I've seen this stated elsewhere in reviews and I too have to say that it has rare stuttering issues where a game or other program will freeze suddenly for about a second or two before resuming. It isn't major but it's still an annoyance, and I hope it gets fixed with a software update eventually.The larger problems, to me, are that the touchpad is absolutely massive, way bigger than my old laptop, and I have to keep it disabled constantly because it's way too easy to accidentally press when typing, and that the screw for the second M.2 SSD slot cannot be removed. I don't know who or what tightened that screw down but it's down so tightly that I cannot move it at all, no matter how much force I try to apply, to the point that I'm absolutely certain that the force required to remove it would be impossible without stripping the screw and also damaging internal parts around it.It's kind of mean to sell a laptop with a second M.2 slot that has a nonfunctional screw. I plugged in an SSD anyway and am just using the laptop case to hold it in place, which has a risk of it popping out, though said risk is lessened by me not taking my laptop with me outside anywhere so there's very little chance of it being jostled.",Great but has issues,True,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars

It was delivered on time and came brand new.",Great Laptop,True,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars

B0CRDCXRK2,A good budget gaming laptop. Entry level but latest hardware.  Chassis is well built.  The lack of number pad may be an issue for some gamers.  Keyboard is good quality.  The FHD display is quite acceptable at this price and has a thin bezel.  The three fans are quite and do a good job.  Asus customer service is quite responsive.  All in all a well rounded package at a reasonable price.Declaration of interest:  a 90 day warranty extension from ASUS may be granted for writing this review.,well built,True,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars
B0CRDCXRK2,"La Asus rog strix G16, fue una excelente compra, apenas la abrí me quede maravillado con la calidad del material que fue diseñada, se ve super resistente, es muy bonita, las luces se ven increibles, En el momento de probarla se nota que es una laptop muy potente, la compré especialmente porque estoy cambiando de equipo, acabo de pasar de una Hp Omen con tarjeta de video GTX960 a esta increible laptop con tarjeta de video RTX4060, es un gran cambio. Acabo de instalarle juegos como red dead redemption 2  y programas de edicion de fotos como adobe illustrator, en donde demostró su máximo esplendor, sin paros, a su máxima potencia.",Excelente compra,True,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars

B0CRDCXRK2,"product came quickly and runs smoothly, all games tested run at highest settings with no issues without overheating the gpu. only complaint is the disk size, 1TB should be standard while this was 512gb. Overall major upgrade from what I was previously using so that is no big issue and can be upgraded, plays everything with no problems so I'm happy with the purchase",great computer,True,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars

B0CRDCXRK2,"I'm so frustrated with this seller, the first laptop I purchased from them was the 2024 model with the 4060 graphics card, i7 processor, well the laptop arrived, but anytime I turned it on or opened it up, it would take 15-20 minutes for the screen to actually turn on so that I could use it. After several days of trying everything I could think of and everything support suggested to fix it, I decided to return it and get a different one.No cue my real anger, after the replacement arrived, which was sent via UPS and was a hassle to get, I open the box, boot up the laptop, and immediately notice that this replacement looks different and has different amounts of USB ports, HDMI ports, etc, so after I pull up the about info, they sent me a laptop with a 3060, not the 4060 one I paid for, and with a worse processor, smaller SSD, everything was worse. So now I'm initiating a second return.All this to say buyer beware, don't make the same expensive mistake I did. Stay away from this seller.",Please read this review before purchasing,True,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2023",1.0 out of 5 stars
B0CRDCXRK2,"La estoy utilizando para la universidad y jugar ocasionalmente, me sorprendio la duracion de la bateria para ver videos y hacer ofimatica en comparacion con mi anterior Predator Helios 300 modelo 2018, en verdad es pesada pero si llegas a comprarla ya debes de estar consiente de ello. No me gusta que cada vez que desconecto o conecto el cargador se apague la pantalla (milesegundos) y que no tenga  pad numerico de verdad hace falta (en mi caso).",Excelente precio calidad,True,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars
